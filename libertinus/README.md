* [ ] Fix Greek. Italic (regular, semibold, bold) looks only slanted instead of real italic. Adapt GFS Porson (OFL) and MathJax Computer Modern (Apache License v.2) - use Porson "curls". The other reason is that CM Greek letters look much better - ideal for math (also take regular and italic Υ and Ω from CM). Fix regular (bold and semibold also) μ (adapt from Noto Serif - Apache License v.2) and regular ψ (blend of Noto Serif and Libertinus Serif). Also see PorsonSpecimen.pdf.
* [ ] [Fix Cyrillic](https://github.com/khaledhosny/libertinus/issues/74). It doesn't have bold italic. Semibold italic is only slanted instead of real italic. Use PT Astra Serif (OFL) and Noto Serif (Apache License v.2).
* [ ] Take ∂ from PT Astra Serif.
